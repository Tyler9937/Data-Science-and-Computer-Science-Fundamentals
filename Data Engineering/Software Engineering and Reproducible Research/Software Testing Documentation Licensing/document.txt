Commenting and documenting code is very important. this can be done with inline comments and multyline comments.
mulitline comments or docstrings will be ignored by the interpretor and will be picked up by pydoc. when ever help() is run
in the repel these docstrings will be grabbed and displayed. documentation and testing is critical to code.
